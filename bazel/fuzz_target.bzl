    The target `<name>` is a `test_suite` tagged with `"manual"`that can be used to run all
    individual instances of the fuzz target test at once. The individual tests are tagged with
    `"benchmark"` and `"manual"`. This is meant to run in CI and ensure that the maximum number of
    runs does not regress.

    The target `<name>.stats` can be run with `bazel run` to execute the benchmark and derive some
    statistics about the number of runs.

    This macro is set up specifically to make efficient use of Bazel's scheduling and caching
    capabilities: By having one target per run instead of a single target that runs the fuzz test
    multiple times, Bazel can schedule the runs concurrently and avoid timeouts on slow runners.
    When increasing the number of seeds, existing results can be reused from the cache.

    Args:
      num_seeds: The number of different seeds to try; corresponds to the number of individual tests
        generated.
      max_runs: The maximum number of runs that each individual test is allowed to run for. Keep
        this as low as possible with a small margin to catch regressions.
