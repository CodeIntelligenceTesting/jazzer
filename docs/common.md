### Passing arguments

Jazzer provides many configuration settings. An up-to-date list can be found by running Jazzer with the `--help` flag.

The value of a setting item `some_opt` is obtained from the following sources in increasing order of precedence:

- the default value
- `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` attribute `Jazzer-Some-Opt` on the classpath
- the `JAZZER_SOME_OPT` environment variable
- the `jazzer.some_opt` system property
- the `jazzer.some_opt` JUnit configuration parameter
- the `--some_opt` CLI parameter

### Reproducing a finding

When Jazzer manages to find an input that causes an uncaught exception or a failed assertion, it prints a Java stack trace and creates two files that aid in reproducing the crash without Jazzer:

* `crash-<sha1_of_input>` contains the raw bytes passed to the fuzz target (just as with libFuzzer C/C++ fuzz targets).
  The crash can be reproduced with Jazzer by passing the path to the crash file as the only positional argument.
* `Crash-<sha1_of_input>.java` contains a class with a `main` function that invokes the fuzz target with the crashing input.
  This is especially useful if using `FuzzedDataProvider` as the raw bytes of the input do not directly correspond to the values consumed by the fuzz target.
  The `.java` file can be compiled with just the fuzz target and its dependencies in the classpath (plus `jazzer_standalone.jar` or `com.code-intelligence:jazzer-api:<version>` if using `FuzzedDataProvider`).

### Minimizing a crashing input

Every crash stack trace is accompanied by a `DEDUP_TOKEN` that uniquely identifies the relevant parts of the stack trace.
This value is used by libFuzzer while minimizing a crashing input to ensure that the smaller inputs reproduce the "same" bug.
To minimize a crashing input, execute Jazzer with the following arguments in addition to `--cp` and `--target_class`:

```bash
-minimize_crash=1 <path/to/crashing_input>
```

### Parallel execution

libFuzzer offers the `-fork=N` and `-jobs=N` flags for parallel fuzzing, both of which are also supported by Jazzer.

### Autofuzz mode

The Autofuzz mode enables fuzzing arbitrary methods without having to manually create fuzz targets.
Instead, Jazzer will attempt to generate suitable and varied inputs to a specified methods using only public API functions available on the classpath.

To use Autofuzz, specify the `--autofuzz` flag and provide a fully [qualified method reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.13), e.g.:
```
--autofuzz=org.apache.commons.imaging.Imaging::getBufferedImage
```
To autofuzz a constructor the `ClassType::new` format can be used.
If there are multiple overloads, and you want Jazzer to only fuzz one, you can optionally specify the signature of the method to fuzz:
```
--autofuzz=org.apache.commons.imaging.Imaging::getBufferedImage(java.io.InputStream,java.util.Map)
```
The format of the signature agrees with that obtained from the part after the `#` of the link to the Javadocs for the particular method.

Under the hood, Jazzer tries various ways of creating objects from the fuzzer input.
For example, if a parameter is an interface or an abstract class, it will look for all concrete implementing classes on the classpath.
Jazzer can also create objects from classes that follow the [builder design pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/creational-design-patterns#builder) or have a default constructor and use setters to set the fields.

Creating objects from fuzzer input can lead to many reported exceptions.
Jazzer addresses this issue by ignoring exceptions that the target method declares to throw.
In addition to that, you can provide a list of exceptions to be ignored during fuzzing via the `--autofuzz_ignore` flag in the form of a comma-separated list.
You can specify concrete exceptions (e.g., `java.lang.NullPointerException`), in which case also subclasses of these exception classes will be ignored, or glob patterns to ignore all exceptions in a specific package (e.g. `java.lang.*` or `com.company.**`).
