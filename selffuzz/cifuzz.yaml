## Configuration for a CI Fuzz project
## Generated on 2023-06-15

## The build system used to build this project. If not set, cifuzz tries
## to detect the build system automatically.
## Valid values: "bazel", "cmake", "maven", "gradle", "other".
#build-system: cmake

## If the build system type is "other", this command is used by
## `cifuzz run` to build the fuzz test.
#build-command: "make my_fuzz_test"

## Directories containing sample inputs for the code under test.
## See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#corpus
#seed-corpus-dirs:
# - path/to/seed-corpus

## A file containing input language keywords or other interesting byte
## sequences.
## See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#dictionaries
#dict: path/to/dictionary.dct

## Command-line arguments to pass to libFuzzer.
## See https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html#options
#engine-args:
# - -rss_limit_mb=4096

## Maximum time to run fuzz tests. The default is to run indefinitely.
#timeout: 30m

## By default, fuzz tests are executed in a sandbox to prevent accidental
## damage to the system. Set to false to run fuzz tests unsandboxed.
## Only supported on Linux.
#use-sandbox: false

## Set to true to print output of the `cifuzz run` command as JSON.
#print-json: true

## Set to true to disable desktop notifications.
#no-notifications: true

## Set URL of the CI App.
#server: https://app.code-intelligence.com

## Set the project name on the CI App.
#project: my-project-1a2b3c4d

## Style for CI Fuzz.
#style: plain
